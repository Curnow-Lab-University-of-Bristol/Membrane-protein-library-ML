# Extracting design sequences
The Rosetta design run in Hardy et al (2023) PNAS 120 (16) e2300137120 generated 18,339 independent computational design decoys. These design decoys were extracted from 50 Rosetta silent files using the ***extract.pdbs*** command. Silent file #22 was prematurely terminated because of a time limit imposed during the design run and so was treated separately from the other 49 files, which were extracted in a single batch. The relevant flags were:
```
-in:file:silent <filename1> <filename2> <filename3>â€¦
-linmem_ig 20
-ignore_unrecognized_res true
-extra_res_fa HEMred.params
-out:path:pdb output
-out:path:all output
-missing_density_to_jump true
```
Using Rosetta 3.14 and the Slurm command:
```
srun extract_pdbs.serialization.linuxgccrelease
```
